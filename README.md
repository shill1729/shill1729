- Hi, I’m @shill1729
- I’m interested in theory and applications of probability, stochastic processes, and numerical methods. I also like to try to do basic game developement for a hobby.
- I’m currently earning a masters in data science at UAlbany.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving my interests, if I can help.
